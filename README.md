 Daily Quote App

This is a simple full-stack app that displays a quote of the day. At the moment everyone can add new quotes and favorite them. The frontend is built with Vue.js and deployed on Netlify. The backend uses Node.js, connected to MongoDB Atlas, and is hosted on Render. In the future I will add admin key check (for quick security).
